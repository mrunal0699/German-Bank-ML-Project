ML for Loan Default Prediction Project

Overview:
Welcome to the ML for Loan Default Prediction project! This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict loan default based on historical customer data.

Project Structure:

The project directory is organized as follows:

Project: ML for Loan Default Prediction ("\Final Project German Bank\code")

Folders:

1. data:
   - This folder contains the dataset 'German_bank.csv' used for training and testing the machine learning models.
   - Path: "\Final Project German Bank\data".

2. code:
   - The "code" folder houses all the Python scripts required for various stages of the project.
   - It includes:
     - data folder: This folder consists of 'cleaned_data.csv', which contains the cleaned data from the provided original data.
       - Path: "\Final Project German Bank\code\data\cleaned_data.csv".
     - data_preprocessing.py: This script is responsible for reading, exploring, and cleaning the data.
       - Path: "\Final Project German Bank\code\data_preprocessing.py".
     - data_visualization.py: Here, you'll find code related to data manipulation, wrangling, and visualization.
       - Path: "\Final Project German Bank\code\data_visualization.py".
     - model_training.py: This script handles the training of machine learning models and the generation of related figures and tables.
       - Path: "\Final Project German Bank\code\model_training.py".

3. reports:
   - In this folder, you'll discover the final project report presented in PDF format.
   - Path: "\Final Project German Bank\report".

How to Use:

1. Begin by exploring the dataset located in the "data" folder:
   - Path: "\Final Project German Bank\data\German_bank.csv".

2. To preprocess the data, navigate to the "code" folder and use the "data_preprocessing.py" script.

3. For data visualization and manipulation, take a look at the "data_visualization.py" script.

4. To train machine learning models and generate figures and tables, use the "model_training.py" script.

5. The final project report can be found in the "reports" folder:
   - Path: "\Final Project German Bank\report".
